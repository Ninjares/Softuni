1. npm install @angular/cli -g
2. add ..\NodeJs\node_modules\angular-cli\bin\ng to PATH
3. ng new <app-name> to create new project
4. Fix index.d.ts error by commenting the errored line thus removing it 
5. "ng serve -open" to compile
6. Use "ng generate component <component name>" to create angular components
7. Use "ng generate service <service name>" for services

"ng init" for existing projects

preferably use the latest version of node, NVM (star on your github can help you with that)
